- Here I predict that AI will replace most programmers within 10 years. 

- In the future, the direction of programmers will shift to the era of digital biology and reality neural networks.

- Humanity will usher in the cyber era, and organs other than the brain will be replaced by machines. Human life span will be greatly increased. 

- Gender will be freely chosen and changeable. You can have characteristics of both men and women, or neither.

- This world will have one common language, that is prompt language which has a special rule for contacting with AI. 

- AI will be combined with humans, not only in our cyber moduels, but also in our life.

- Sharing perception will be one of the hot topic, you can share your feeling with anyone through remote connection. 

- Human abilities will be greatly improved with the blessing of AI.

- Human ambition can lead to extinction, which is "the end". Unless we can communicate our mind with each other though meta network before that.
