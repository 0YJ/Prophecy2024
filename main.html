        <h2>Future Predictions</h2>
        <p>Here I predict that AI will replace most programmers within 10 years.</p>
        <p>In the future, the direction of programmers will shift to the era of digital biology and reality neural networks.</p>
        <p>Humanity will usher in the cyber era, and organs other than the brain will be replaced by machines. Human lifespan will be greatly increased.</p>
        <p>Gender will be freely chosen and changeable. You can have characteristics of both men and women, or neither.</p>
        <p>This world will have one common language, that is prompt language which has a special rule for contacting with AI.</p>
        <p>AI will be combined with humans, not only in our cyber modules, but also in our life.</p>
        <p>Sharing perception will be one of the hot topics, you can share your feeling with anyone through remote connection.</p>
        <p>Human abilities will be greatly improved with the blessing of AI.</p>
        <p>Human ambition can lead to extinction, which is "the end". Unless we can communicate our mind with each other through meta network before that.</p>
